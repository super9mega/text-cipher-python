# text-cipher
this program is a modified Vigen√®re cipher, its made in order to encrypt and decrypt text so that two people can secure conversation 
by either paper in real life, or a text file, assuming that they have the key. it also uses a modified Caesar cipher in order to add
numbers and symbols to the allowed words and create a more secure message, you could also in theory change the order or add
more chacters to the pattern to improve security

note, this is just a simple example, and I may add Curses later to improve look of message generation
